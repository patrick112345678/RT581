/**
   @par LL protocol API for higher layer at Host

   Currently have no ideas which platform will be on Host.
   Seems can't suppose there is any multitasking support 9tasks, threads etc).
   So now supppose the most complex case: some kind of hand-made scheduler developed by the customer which runs some main loop
   LL protocol must be integrated into that main loop. LL level can't have its own internal thread/task.
   I/o level which is under LL works using interrupts.
   Most Ll logic works in the customer's main loop when customer's application gives a time quant to LL.

   LL can ask for time quant from the user's Host application by
   calling a callback.  HL can give a quant to Ll by calling its main
   entry potint. Same call is used to initiate transmit from HL, to
   pass received packet from Ll to HL, to ask HL to call LL entry
   point after pre-defined timeout.

/**
   Initialize LL protocol and i/o layer below LL protocol.

   Call of call_me_cb means "LL wants HL to call ncp_host_ll_quant() from the main loop context".
   In most cases call_me_cb is called from ISR, so HL must limit its actions done from that callback.

   Call of call_me_cb asks for immediate call of ncp_host_ll_quant and
   canceling of LL alarm (call to ncp_host_ll_quant after timeout).

   To be called from HL in the main execution loop context.
   ncp_host_ll_quant() does following:
   - schedules HL packet transmission if tx_size is not zero
   - passes next received packet up to HL if rx_buf_size is not zero and received packet exists
   - asks HL to call ncp_host_ll_quant after timeout.
   ncp_host_ll_quant() never blocks.

   @param tx_buf             - (in) pointer to HL packet to send. NULL if nothing to send
   @param tx_size            - (in) size of HL packets to send. 0 if nothing to send
   @param rx_buf             - (in) pointer to HL's buffer for next received packet. NULL if HL don't want to receive next packet.
   @param rx_buf_size        - (in) size of rx packet buffer. 0 if HL don't want to receive next packet.
   @param received_bytes     - (out) size of the packet passed to HL. If no packet received, *received_bytes is 0.
   @param alarm_timeout_ms   - (out) delay to next call to ncp_host_ll_quant(), in ms. 0 if LL requests to call it immediately.
