- All Zigbee roles
- Zigbee 3.0 and SE_
- Green power infrastructure (GPPB, GPCB)
- Green Power Device (debug implementation based on ZBOSS MAC - not for production use) - _to be verified!_
- Debug trace over UART
- Support of LEDs and buttons at SmartRF06 devboard
Known issues and limitations:
- No power saving implemented: neither radio off nor MCU put asleep at sleepy ZED
- Injected LEAVE feature is implemented using a "sticky pending bit": parent always set Pending bit ON in MAC ACKs to POLL packets.
