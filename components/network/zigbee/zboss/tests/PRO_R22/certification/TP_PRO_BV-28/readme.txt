Initial conditions:
1. Reset ZC
2. Set gZC, under target stack profile,gZC as co-coordinator starts a PAN with a random value (within the range 0x1 to 0x3FFF)

Test procedure:
1 gZED1 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
2 gZED2 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
3 gZED3 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
4 gZED4 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
5 gZED5 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
6 gZED6 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
7 gZED7 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
8 gZED8 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
9 gZED9 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
10 gZED10 performs startup procedure and joins the PAN network with Rx on idle = True
11 By application specific means, reset all addresses and table entries within DUT ZC, gZED1, gZED2, gZED3, gZED4, gZED5, gZED6, gZED7, gZED8, gZED9, and gZED10.
12 Repeat items 1 â€“ 12 a further 9 times.

Pass verdict:
1) On startup each gZED shall  issue an MLME_Beacon Request MAC command frame, and DUT ZC shall respond with beacon. 
Based on the active scan result the gZED shall complete the MAC association sequence with DUT ZC 
and get a new (unrepeated) short address from the DUT ZC (Generated in a random manner within the range 1 to 0xFFF7)
The gZED shall then issue a device Announce
2) A total of 100 unrepeated short addresses shall be assigned by the DUT ZC (ie. 10 gZEDs x 10 startups) 

Fail verdict:
1) On startup each gZED does not issue an MLME_Beacon Request MAC command frame, and DUT ZC does not respond with a beacon. 
Based on the active scan result the gZED does not complete the MAC association sequence with DUT ZC and does not get 
a new (unrepeated) short address from the DUT ZC (Generated in a random manner within the range 1 to 0xFFF7)
The gZED does not then issue a device Announce
2) A total of 100 unrepeated short addresses are not assigned by the DUT ZC (ie. 10 gZEDs x 10 startups)
