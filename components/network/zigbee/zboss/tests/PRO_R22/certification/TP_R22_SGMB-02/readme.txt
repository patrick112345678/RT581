13.2 TP/R22/SGMB-02 Joining the Sub-GHz network with Power Negotiation â€“ DUT ZigBee End Devices

Verify that the end devices on Sub-GHz network, one with Rx on idle = true and one Rx on
idle = false, are capable to join a network with Sub-GHz power negotiation between a
ZigBee Coordinator and ZigBee End Devices. This test is two way power negotiation with
ZEDs as DUT and ZMC as golden unit.
