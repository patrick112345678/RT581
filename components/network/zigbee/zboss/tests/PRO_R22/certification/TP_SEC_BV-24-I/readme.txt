DUT ZC
PANId=0x1AAA 
0x0000
Coordinator external address:
0x aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa

gZR1
Router extended address:
0x 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00

gZED1
End Device extended address:
0x 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01
(sleepy device)


Initial conditions:
1. All devices have joined using the well-known Trust Center Link Key (ZigBeeAlliance09), have performed a Request Key to obtain a new Link Key, and have confirmed that key with the Verify Key Command.  
ZC set with permit join enabled and  ZR1 with permit join disabled.
2. gZED1 specifies an End Device Timeout of 4 minutes.  It has switched off polling at the start of the test.  The test must be run within the 4-minute timeout.
3. The value of the NWK key used initially may be any value, and is known as KEY0 for this test.  The Key Sequence number shall be 0.


Test procedure:
1. DUT ZC selects a new network key via platform specific means.  The key must have a different value than KEY0.  The new key is known as KEY1.  It initiates a broadcast NWK Key update.  
2. DUT ZC shall notify all devices that they must switch to the new network key. 
3. DUT ZC sends a message buffer test request to router gZR1.
4. Force gZED1( sleepy end device) to initiate a Trust Center Rejoin Request.
5. DUT ZC accepts gZED1 rejoining.
6. gZED1 completes the rejoin.


Pass verdict:
1. DUT ZC Broadcasts an APS Transport Key to the all devices address 0xFFFF.  The message shall only be NWK encrypted with KEY0.  The APS Transport Key contents shall contain KEY1 and the Key sequence shall be 1.
All routers relay the broadcast.  The End Device does not get the APS Transport Key command.  
2. DUT ZC sends an APS Switch Key Command broadcast to the all devices address 0xFFFF. The command shall be encrypted with the new key sequence number 1.  
All routers relay the broadcast.  The End Device does not get the APS switch key command.
3. gZR1 sends back a message buffer test response that is encrypted at the NWK layer with KEY1.
4. gZR1 sends back a Rejoin Response with status of success.   gZR3 sends an APS Update Device command to DUT ZC.  
5. DUT ZC sends an APS Tunnel command to gZR1.  gZR1 sends an APS Transport Key encrypted with gZED1â€™s Trust Center link key.  The Transport Key contains KEY1 with key sequence number 1.
6. gZED1 broadcasts a device announce encrypted at the NWK layer with KEY1.
