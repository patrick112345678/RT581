Test described in GP test specification, clause 4.2.2 Basics and 4.2.2.1 ApplicationID = 0b000

Test Harness tool - as ZR
Test Harnes GPD   - as ZGPD
DUT GPS           - GPS as ZC

dut_gps starts as ZC, th-tool joins to network

TH-GPD and DUT-GPS have a pairing with 
    ApplicationID = 0b000, 
    SrcID = A, 
    TH-GPD uses incremental MAC sequence number.
    A pairing is established between the TH-GPD and DUT-GPS
    (e.g. as a result of any of the commissioning procedures).
    Initial MAC sequence number is Z.
Note: Only basic GPDF frame format reception is tested here.
      Filtering of the GPD ID is tested separately.
      Duplicate filtering (based on GPDâ€™s Sequence number capabilities) to be tested separately.
      Rx capabilities are tested separately, with bidirectional operation.
      Security is also tested separately.
