TP-CST-TC-21: Color control cluster (color temperature) with server as DUT

This test applies to the color loop mechanism in the color control cluster.

ZED - ZLL ED, namely Dimmable light (single endpoint).
ZR  - ZLL router, namely Non-Color Scene Controller. The device is address-assignment-capable
      (i. e. compiled with ZB_ROUTER_ROLE defined).

Prepare steps
1.  Start ZR and ZED both as factory new ZLL devices. Both of them check that they
    are in initial state and idle (i. e. not connected to any network). Both
    of them are limited to use the first ZLL primary channel only.
2.  ZED starts Device Discovery procedure by sending ZLL.Commissioning.Scan request.
3.  ZR responds with ZLL.Commissioning.Scan response.
5.  ZED starts Start New Network procedure with all needs parameters
6.  ZR start new network and response ZED.
7.  ZED rejoin this network.
8.  ZED send On command.
9.  ZED send Remove all groups command.
10. ZED unicasts a ZCL Move to Color command frame to ZR with the ColorX and ColorY
    fields set to appropriate values for a red color and the transition time field
    set to 0x000a (1s).
